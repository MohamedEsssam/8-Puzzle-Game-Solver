# 8-Puzzle-Game-Solver
### AI project to solve 8-puzzle game using DFS and BFS and A* Algorithms and animate the output path "Solution" using javafx

# used data structure:
### 1- Stack for DFS Algorithm
### 2- Queue for BFS Algorithm
### 3- PriorityQueue for A* Algorithm and used manhattan and euclidean distance to calculate cost
